fun with encryption

how it works is pretty simple

step 1: run the seedgen script

step 2: write a message in the input text file, it sadly will only work with the alphabet and spaces

step 3: run the encode script

if you want to decode it run the decode script
however if you change the seed.text you'll never recover your message
